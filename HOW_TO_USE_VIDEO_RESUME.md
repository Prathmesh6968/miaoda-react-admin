# How to Use Video Resume Feature

## 🎬 What is Video Resume?

Video Resume is a feature that remembers where you stopped watching an episode, so you can continue from that exact point when you return. No more manual seeking!

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Sign In
To use the Video Resume feature, you need to be signed in to your account.

**Why?** Progress is saved to your account so you can access it from any device.

### Step 2: Start Watching
1. Browse anime and select an episode
2. Start watching the video
3. Your progress is automatically saved every 10 seconds

### Step 3: Return Anytime

2. Come back later and click the same episode
3. You'll see a "Resume Watching?" prompt

### Step 4: Choose Your Option
**Option 1: Resume**
- Click "Resume from [time]" to continue where you left off
- Video will start from your last position

**Option 2: Start Over**
- Click "Start from Beginning" to watch from the start
- Your saved progress will be reset
